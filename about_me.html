            I graduated from high school in Darwin where I studied mostly STEM subjects and represented the school in math and science competitions. During my time at school
            I also played music performing on Clarinet in the youth orchestras and concert bands. I then went onto university studying Electronic Engineering I dropped at the end of 2nd year to help support my parents.
            I went on to work in electronic retail and started learning sound engineering I eventually pursued a career in corporate AV specialising in Video systems.

            I’ve had many hobbies in addition to being semi professional musician playing clarinet and saxophone, I enjoy boards games, computer games, camping and cooking. 
            The hobby I’m most passionate about is scuba diving. Due to its proximity to Darwin I’ve spent a lot of time underwater off the coast of Bali and Lombok.
            I've also spent a bit of time diving around South Australian costal waters.
